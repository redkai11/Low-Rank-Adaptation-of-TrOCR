# Low-Rank-Adaptation-of-TrOCR

This repository contains code and resources to finetune an existing transformer model for the task of recognizing car license plates using an Image-to-Text Encoder-Decoder architecture based on the Transformer model. The model is inspired by the principles outlined in the paper A Transformer-based Encoder-Decoder Architecture for Image-to-Text Recognition.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to adapt a pre-existing transformer model for license plate recognition, leveraging its capability to understand the spatial relationships in images and generate corresponding textual representations.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on an Encoder-Decoder based Transformer. Encoder is similar to that of ViT (Vision Transformer).

## Dataset
The model will be finetuned on car license plate dataset provided by
